# <NAME OF THE TOOL>
  Finding condition-specific genes using the Association Plots.
  For more details, please see our tutorial.
  
  # Introduction
  Blablabla is an interactive application developed using R package Shiny. After uploading the input matrix and choosing the parameters, the tool generates the 2D- and 3D-representation of the data, as well as the Association Plot for any selected  condition or set of conditions. To identify the condition-specific genes one can zoom in the generated Association Plot and click the mouse over the genes presented in the plot. The tool allows also for enrichment analysis of the condition-specific genes based on the human or mouse gene ontology.
